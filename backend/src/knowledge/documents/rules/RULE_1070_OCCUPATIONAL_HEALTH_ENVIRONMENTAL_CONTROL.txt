RULE 1070: OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1071: GENERAL PROVISIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1071.01 The employer shall exert efforts to maintain and control the working environment in comfortable and healthy conditions for the purpose of promoting and maintaining the health of his workers.

1071.02 The employer shall carry out the Work Environment Measurement (WEM) where hazardous work is performed and shall keep a record of such measurement which shall be made available to the enforcing authority.

1071.03 "Threshold Limit Values" refer to airborne concentrations of substances and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed daily without adverse effect.

1071.04 The Regional Office or the Bureau concerned may make special threshold limit values when values for specific substances are not found in the standard tables.

1071.05 The Secretary shall periodically review the threshold limit values and shall revise and update the standards.

1071.06 Technical Committee:
The member of the technical committee shall either be a physician, engineer, chemist or nurse who has completed at least an occupational health/occupational safety and health-training course required by this Standards, and who has been a practitioner for not less than three (3) years. Other members of the technical committee shall be drawn from the labor and employers' sectors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1072: THRESHOLD LIMIT VALUES FOR AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1072.01 Threshold limit values refer to time weighted concentrations for an 8-hour workday and a total of forty-eight (48) hours work of exposure per week.

1072.02 Types of Threshold Limit Values:

(a) Ceiling Values (C): Materials preceded by "C" in the tables have ceiling values that should never be exceeded, even instantaneously.

(b) Time-Weighted Average (TWA): Materials not preceded by "C" follow 8-hour time-weighted averages, with permissible short-term excursions provided the TWA is not exceeded.

(c) Skin Notation: When "Skin" is noted after a substance, it indicates potential significant contribution to overall exposure through skin absorption, including mucous membranes and eyes, by direct or airborne contact.

1072.03 Control Measures:

Administrative/engineering controls must first be implemented before protective equipment shall be used to keep exposure of workers to air contaminants within threshold limit values prescribed.

Priority of Controls:
(a) Elimination of hazard
(b) Substitution with less hazardous materials
(c) Engineering controls (ventilation, enclosure)
(d) Administrative controls (work schedules, training)
(e) Personal protective equipment (as last resort)
